-- | The generation record and its identity (spec section 5: the generation
-- event is pinned -- model, prompt, inputs, raw reply -- and committed with
-- the engine; record = provenance).
--
-- 'genId' names a record by content: every decision in a minted @.lang@ is
-- stamped @\@gen:\<genId record\>@, so any engine line points at the exact
-- generation event that produced it, and the link is mechanically checkable
-- (re-hash the @.generation@ file, compare the stamp). The hash is FNV-1a
-- 64-bit: an /identifier/, not a security boundary -- the record sits in the
-- same repository as the stamp, so tampering is a git problem, not a
-- cryptography problem. Pure Haskell keeps the kernel free of external
-- hashing dependencies.

-- | The auditable record of a generation event: everything the model saw and
-- said, self-contained (the system prompt is embedded, not referenced, so the
-- record stays honest even after the prompt artifact evolves). Stored as
-- @\<file\>.generation@, committed beside the engine.

-- The confidence threshold is part of the event: it co-determines what was
-- admitted (deduce-or-fail), so a record that omitted it would not pin the
-- event. It therefore also enters 'genId', so re-running with a different
-- threshold yields a different id.
